    <p>This should tell the user what is going on as they use D2L and many of its functions. For the most part, D2L gives pretty good user feedback after most if not all actions the user performs. This can be seen from the very beginning when you hover over one of your classes, the website zooms in on the image representing that class (visual feedback to show it is clickable). Perhaps my favorite is the feedback you are given to your email that is proof that you submitted something (drop box submission receipts). These are very useful to know your submission was successful (example picture of this is show below).

    <p>A few other things that really help are reminders that assignments are due soon, updates on an assignment that was just graded, and progress bars that fill over time as they upload your assignment.</p>
